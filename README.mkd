##Tracelytics Munin Templates##

Based on Jeremy Clarke's Raven templates
(http://simianuprising.com/2011/02/19/raven-my-custom-theme-templates-for-munin/),
which makes the licence for this the GPL.

This is just stuff we had to do to get the templates working--remove broken
links, make img tags have src attributes by default (?), etc.

###Installation note###

You'll need to copy `raven.js` and `munin-logo-305x80.png` into the web root
for munin's generated files.
